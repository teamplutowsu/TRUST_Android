Advance Care Plan Components

An advance care plan can consist of any number of written
documents including:
❚ An advance care directive.
❚ A do-not-resuscitate order.
❚ A living will.
❚ A power of attorney.
❚ A financial plan.
These documents are discussed in more detail in the
following sections. Your doctor, nurse, or hospital can give
you information and written materials about advance care
planning. Many agencies on aging, state and national bar
associations, and medical societies may also be good
sources of information.
You may wish to use a lawyer with experience in estate
planning or elder care to help you prepare an advance
care plan to ensure that it meets your individual wishes
and state legal requirements. 

Advance Care Directive

You or another person that you specify can provide guidance
about your future medical care in a document called an advance
care directive. An advance care directive should provide clear
evidence of your wishes regarding treatment and can include
a living will, a durable health care power of attorney, and a
statement about organ donation.
A U.S. federal law called the Patient Self-Determination Act
requires hospitals, nursing facilities, hospices, home health
agencies, and other health care providers participating in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs to give all patients written
information about their rights to accept or refuse medical or
surgical treatment and to make advance directives.
