Importance of an Advance Care Plan

Telling people what you want helps them care for you in a way
that best meets your wishes. It may also increase communication
about end-of-life needs and concerns and make life less stressful
for you. Knowing that you have made arrangements for your care
may even improve your outlook for the future. It can also make it
easier for your family to make decisions about your care.
