Heart failure is a serious chronic condition that can shorten your
life. With proper management and active self-care, you can feel
better, decrease your chances of being in the hospital, and live
longer. Advances in treatment can slow, stop, or in some cases
reverse the progression of heart failure. However, even with
the best medical care, heart failure may progress over time.
The progress of heart failure is unpredictable and different for
each person, so you may feel uncertain about what to expect
in the future. Therefore, it is important for you and your family
to talk about how you want to be cared for in the future should
you become very ill and unable to make decisions about your
medical care. One way to plan for such a possibility is to make
an advance care plan.
Making an advance care plan can ease worries about what might
happen to you if you are unable to make decisions about your
own care or about death and dying. Getting answers to your
questions and letting people know what you want at the end
of your life can help you feel more in control and give you peace
of mind as you go about living your life. An advance care plan is
a good idea for all adults, regardless of their medical history.
This module will discuss topics related to advance care planning
that you can think about and talk over with your family. There
are no right or wrong decisions on these topics, so you can be
open and honest about your feelings and make choices that are
best for you. ');

An advance care plan is a written document that helps you
to ensure that your care is customized to reflect your personal
preferences and health needs, as well as meet your social,
cultural, and religious requirements. It covers issues such as
whether you want to be resuscitated (revived if your heart stops
beating) or whether you want to have a mechanical ventilator
breathe for you if needed. You can also specify how you want
pain relieved if it develops and talk about how other medical
problems and complications should be handled if they occur.
An advance care plan does not guarantee that your instructions
will be followed, but it does substantially increase the likelihood.
Making sure that your advance care plan conforms to any legal
requirements in your state helps ensure that your health care
providers will comply with it.
Even if you do not create a written advance care plan, it
is important to let your health care providers, family, and
other caretakers know about your wishes regarding future
medical care. ');

An advance care plan can consist of any number of written
documents including:
??? An advance care directive.
??? A do-not-resuscitate order.
??? A living will.
??? A power of attorney.
??? A financial plan.
These documents are discussed in more detail in the
following sections. Your doctor, nurse, or hospital can give
you information and written materials about advance care
planning. Many agencies on aging, state and national bar
associations, and medical societies may also be good
sources of information.
You may wish to use a lawyer with experience in estate
planning or elder care to help you prepare an advance
care plan to ensure that it meets your individual wishes
and state legal requirements. 

Advance Care Directive

You or another person that you specify can provide guidance
about your future medical care in a document called an advance
care directive. An advance care directive should provide clear
evidence of your wishes regarding treatment and can include
a living will, a durable health care power of attorney, and a
statement about organ donation.
A U.S. federal law called the Patient Self-Determination Act
requires hospitals, nursing facilities, hospices, home health
agencies, and other health care providers participating in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs to give all patients written
information about their rights to accept or refuse medical or
surgical treatment and to make advance directives. ');
INSERT INTO PAGES (mid, length, version, content) VALUES (1, 2000, 1, 'Advance Care Plan Components

Do-Not-Resuscitate Order
A do-not-resuscitate order is a type of advance care directive
that tells doctors, nurses, and other rescue personnel what they
should or should not do when a person stops breathing or when
their heart beats so irregularly as to threaten life or stops entirely.
The decision to have a do-not-resuscitate order is made by the
patient or his/her family in consultation with the doctor.
A do-not-resuscitate order can include instructions on whether
to use different types of methods to revive a person including:
??? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) ??? Manual chest
pressure and mouth-to-mouth breathing to circulate
blood and oxygenate the lungs.
??? Defibrillation ??? Delivering an electrical shock to the heart
to restore a normal heart beat.
??? Breathing tube and machine ??? Used to assist with breathing.
??? Medicines ??? Given to restore an effective heart rate and
improve circulation of blood to major organs.

Living Will

A living will is a legal document that lets a person who is
unable to participate in decisions about their medical care
express their wishes about life-sustaining treatment. A living
will is usually used during a terminal illness when a person
is unable to communicate. A terminal illness is one in which
death is expected to occur with or without medical intervention
and also applies to an irreversible condition, when there is no
reasonable chance for recovery.
A living will guides health care providers and allows the patient
to set limits on what is done to them. You can personalize your
living will by including specific statements about the use of
medical treatments which may apply to your condition, including
CPR, blood transfusions, mechanical breathing, surgery, antibiotics,
kidney dialysis, and invasive measures to provide nutrition and
fluids. State laws vary in their requirements for living wills, so it
is advisable to contact a lawyer to make a living will that is valid
in your state.');
INSERT INTO PAGES (mid, length, version, content) VALUES (1, 2511, 1, 'Advance Care Plan Components

Health Care Power of Attorney
A power of attorney lets another person make legally binding
decisions for you. A health care power of attorney lets someone
make all health care decisions for you including the decision to
refuse life-sustaining treatment if you are unable to make the
decision for yourself. If you have a living will, the person with a
power of attorney also has the authority to interpret your living
will in the event there are questions about it and make decisions
that he or she believes to be in your best interest.
You can give someone a general power of attorney to make
decisions for you or you can limit their decision-making to
certain issues by including instructions about your care. For
example, you can specify preferences regarding particular
treatments such as tube feeding, intravenous fluids, and organ
donation, to the extent you have not already covered those
subjects in a living will. 
If the power of attorney is a ???durable??? power of attorney this
means that the person authorized to make your health care
decisions can make them even after you become incapacitated.
Having a durable health care power of attorney helps ensure that
the specific person you want to make decisions for you, such as a
family member, will have the legal right to act on your behalf.
While state laws vary, in general, the paperwork granting
someone any type of power of attorney must be signed
voluntarily and be witnessed by a notary public. A power
of attorney must be completed when you are still capable
(competent) of making decisions and before you become
terminally ill. To ensure that a power of attorney complies with
the laws in your state, it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who
has experience in that area of law and can verif

Financial Planning

Heart failure can be expensive to treat. You and your family may
have concerns about paying for medicines, doctor and hospital
bills, and other types of health care. If paying for care is a worry
for you and your family, talk with your doctor or nurse. They can
often help you find ways to pay for medicines, and other health
care bills. Many hospitals or clinics also have social workers that
can help with these issues.
Some drug companies have programs that provide medicines
free to low-income patients if a doctor or nurse fills out special
forms. Do not be shy about applying for these programs if you
meet the criteria. The programs are there to help people get
the medicines they need. ');

As part of responsible planning for the future, everyone should
make an advance care plan. While it may be difficult to discuss
death and dying with family and friends, everyone benefits from
knowing your wishes. Your family and friends may want to know
what you are feeling and thinking but may be afraid to ask you.
It might be easier if you bring the topic up first. For example,
you can trigger a meaningful discussion by saying:
??? ???I???d like to talk about what you should do in the event of
an emergency, especially one involving a cardiac arrest.???
??? ???It seems like I am more tired than I have been in the
past. I???d like to talk about what can be done to make

Communication is an important part of advance care planning
and end-of-life care. (End-of -life is considered the final weeks
of life when death is near.) As you begin to develop an advance
care plan, it is important to have accurate information about
heart failure and the specifics of your condition, so that you know
what might be involved in your care. To get the most up-to-date
information, you should talk to your doctor or nurse and other
members of your heart failure team. You may wish to ask the
following questions during your discussion:
??? Is my heart failure progressing slowly or rapidly?
??? Is my heart failure still responding to medications?
??? Is there anything else that can help me, when my heart
failure no longer responds to my current therapy?
??? Are there things I can be doing better or more of to
improve the quality and length of my life?
??? Do you have a palliative medicine team you routinely
work with? (See page 18 for more information on
palliative care.)
Palliative care does not try to cure a disease but seeks to
soothe, prevent, relieve, or reduce symptoms. It may also include
treatments to help patients reach personal goals, obtain meaning
from everyday life and current experiences, and overcome
conflicts associated with the end-of-life.
??? When is the right time to get a palliative care team involved
in my care?
??? How will I know when my heart condition is worsening?
What signs or symptoms should I expect?
??? Is frequent hospitalization a sign that my heart failure

Some people worry about burdening their families as their
heart failure progresses and about dying in pain. When patients
and families are told ???nothing more can be done???, they often
interpret this to mean that their doctor or hospital will no longer
care for them. This is not true. You are entitled to continue to
receive medical care and have your pain managed no matter
what stage of heart failure you have. Additionally, you can choose
how you will be cared for and where you receive that care as
your heart failure progresses. Some people prefer to be cared for
and die in their homes. Others may prefer to die in a hospital.

??? Palliative care.
??? Hospice care.
??? Home health care.
??? Other supportive care.');
INSERT INTO PAGES (mid, length, version, content) VALUES (1, 2146, 1, 'Making Care Choices

Palliative Care

Palliative care programs are designed to improve the quality
of life of patients and their families when they are faced with a
life-threatening illness. Since the course of heart failure may not
be predictable, this type of program does not have the same
entry requirements as a hospice program, which typically
requires patients to have a life expectancy of 6 months
or less.
Palliative care programs are very similar to hospice programs
in that their goals are patient comfort and quality of life rather
than cure. They typically take many dimensions of a person???s
life into account (physical, social, spiritual, and psychological)
and seek to individualize care to meet the unique needs of each
person. In addition, patient education is part of the care plan
and can include education about ways to decrease shortness of
breath, conserve energy for important activities, and monitor
your condition. 

Hospice Care

Hospice programs promote the notion that dying is a normal
part of living. These programs provide medical and supportive
services to a patient expected to be in the last 6 months of life.
Hospice care can be provided in different settings including the
patient???s home, a hospice unit, or a nursing home.
Hospice programs are intended to provide care and
support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week according to the
following guidelines:
??? The goal of care is to comfort rather than cure the patient.
??? Pain relief and symptom control are designed to meet
the needs and desires of the patient and are obtained by
whatever means necessary.
??? The patient is not treated in isolation. The family is
included in the unit of care.
??? The patient and family can control and set the agenda
for day-to-day care.
??? A multidisciplinary team that includes nurses, volunteers,
chaplains, therapists, bereavement counselors, social
workers, and doctors are there for the patient.
??? Care includes a spiritual component (not specific to one
religion or faith) to help patients discuss and reconcile the
meaning of end-of-life.
??? Long-term bereavement support is available for family
and friends.');

Home Health Care

Whether you choose a palliative care program, a hospice care
program, or no program at all, it is likely that you will feel more
tired and be short of breath as your heart failure progresses. Your
doctors and nurses may recommend home health care nursing
to monitor your status and adjust your therapy to keep you
comfortable without shortness of breath.
A home health care nurse can monitor your vital signs, weight,
heart failure status, blood laboratory work, and medication
dosing. He or she may also administer intravenous medications
at home to decrease your discomfort, pain or difficulty breathing,
and prevent hospitalization.
Other Supportive Care
Occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, and physical
therapists can help you move and breathe more easily and keep
your muscles conditioned so you have fewer aches and pains
with movement. These health care providers can also help you
get equipment so you can do your day-to-day activities more
easily. Examples include a shower stool, wheelchair, scooter,
home oxygen, or a ramp that goes over the stairs.

Taking care of a family member or friend with heart failure can
be a source of pride and a way to express love for that person.
However, caretakers can also get tired and may need support.
This is particularly true as the person with heart failure gets sicker
and needs more help. Caretakers may ignore their own health,
because they are so busy caring for their relative or friend with
heart failure.
Asking for help from other family members and friends or from
home health nurses and aides can help prevent caretakers from
feeling overly burdened. Supporting caretakers as they help a

familiarize yourself with the following terms.
Advance care directives: A document that lets a person give
directions about his or her future medical care or to choose
another person to make medical decisions if the person is not
able to make decisions about his or her health.
Coma: A state of permanent unconscious deep sleep.
Do-not-resuscitate order: A type of advance directive that
specifies when CPR, types of medical treatment, or technology
are to be used or not used to revive a person if they stop
breathing or if their heart beats irregularly or stops entirely.
End-stage heart failure: A stage of heart failure when there is a
loss of response to maximal therapy with medicines and devices,
and the patient has experienced repeated hospitalizations over the
past three months due to severe, ongoing symptoms and distress,
and a heart transplant or support with a ventricular assist device is
not feasible.
Health care power of attorney: A document that involves
choosing a person to be an attorney-in-fact regarding all health care
decisions, including the decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment
when the person is unable to make decisions themselves. A durable
health care power of attorney remains in effect even after you
become incapacitated.
If the person has a living will, the person holding the health
care power of attorney has the authority to interpret the living
will in the event of questions and make decisions that he or she
believes to be in the best interest of the person. 
Hospice: A type of care program that supports patients and their
families through the dying process and helps surviving family
members through bereavement.
Living will: A legal document that lets a person who is unable
to make decisions (usually because of inability to communicate
during a terminal illness) express their wishes about lifesustaining
treatment.
Palliative care: A type of care program that can be used when
a disease is no longer responsive to curative treatment. Palliative
care generally involves treatments that seek to soothe, prevent,
relieve or reduce symptoms.
Resuscitation: Taking measures to save a person???s life in the
event they stop breathing, their heart beats erratically, or
their heart stops beating.
Sudden cardiac arrest: When the heart suddenly stops pumping
enough blood to sustain life, because an electrical problem in
the heart causes an extremely fast and/or chaotic heart rhythm.
Terminal illness: An illness in which death is expected to occur
with or without medical intervention. The term also applies to
an irreversible condition, when there is no reasonable chance for
recovery.
Permanent vegetative state: A state that occurs when there has
been permanent brain damage severe enough that the person is
unaware of their surroundings. The person can not communicate,
understand, or meaningfully appreciate life, and there is no
reasonable chance for recovery. ');
