Questions for Your Doctor or Nurse

Communication is an important part of advance care planning
and end-of-life care. (End-of -life is considered the final weeks
of life when death is near.) As you begin to develop an advance
care plan, it is important to have accurate information about
heart failure and the specifics of your condition, so that you know
what might be involved in your care. To get the most up-to-date
information, you should talk to your doctor or nurse and other
members of your heart failure team. You may wish to ask the
following questions during your discussion:
❚ Is my heart failure progressing slowly or rapidly?
❚ Is my heart failure still responding to medications?
❚ Is there anything else that can help me, when my heart
failure no longer responds to my current therapy?
❚ Are there things I can be doing better or more of to
improve the quality and length of my life?
❚ Do you have a palliative medicine team you routinely
work with? (See page 18 for more information on
palliative care.)
Palliative care does not try to cure a disease but seeks to
soothe, prevent, relieve, or reduce symptoms. It may also include
treatments to help patients reach personal goals, obtain meaning
from everyday life and current experiences, and overcome
conflicts associated with the end-of-life.
❚ When is the right time to get a palliative care team involved
in my care?
❚ How will I know when my heart condition is worsening?
What signs or symptoms should I expect?
❚ Is frequent hospitalization a sign that my heart failure
has worsened to the point that I should think about
end-of-life issues?
Also, be sure to write down any additional questions you may
have about heart failure and your condition.
