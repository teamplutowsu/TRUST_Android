Introduction

Heart failure is a serious chronic condition that can shorten your
life. With proper management and active self-care, you can feel
better, decrease your chances of being in the hospital, and live
longer. Advances in treatment can slow, stop, or in some cases
reverse the progression of heart failure. However, even with
the best medical care, heart failure may progress over time.
The progress of heart failure is unpredictable and different for
each person, so you may feel uncertain about what to expect
in the future. Therefore, it is important for you and your family
to talk about how you want to be cared for in the future should
you become very ill and unable to make decisions about your
medical care. One way to plan for such a possibility is to make
an advance care plan.
Making an advance care plan can ease worries about what might
happen to you if you are unable to make decisions about your
own care or about death and dying. Getting answers to your
questions and letting people know what you want at the end
of your life can help you feel more in control and give you peace
of mind as you go about living your life. An advance care plan is
a good idea for all adults, regardless of their medical history.
This module will discuss topics related to advance care planning
that you can think about and talk over with your family. There
are no right or wrong decisions on these topics, so you can be
open and honest about your feelings and make choices that are
best for you.
