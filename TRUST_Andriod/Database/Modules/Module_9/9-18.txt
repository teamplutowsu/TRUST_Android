Care for the Caretakers

Taking care of a family member or friend with heart failure can
be a source of pride and a way to express love for that person.
However, caretakers can also get tired and may need support.
This is particularly true as the person with heart failure gets sicker
and needs more help. Caretakers may ignore their own health,
because they are so busy caring for their relative or friend with
heart failure.
Asking for help from other family members and friends or from
home health nurses and aides can help prevent caretakers from
feeling overly burdened. Supporting caretakers as they help a
family member or friend who has heart failure is an important
part of helping families.
