Advance Care Plan Components

Do-Not-Resuscitate Order
A do-not-resuscitate order is a type of advance care directive
that tells doctors, nurses, and other rescue personnel what they
should or should not do when a person stops breathing or when
their heart beats so irregularly as to threaten life or stops entirely.
The decision to have a do-not-resuscitate order is made by the
patient or his/her family in consultation with the doctor.
A do-not-resuscitate order can include instructions on whether
to use different types of methods to revive a person including:
❚ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – Manual chest
pressure and mouth-to-mouth breathing to circulate
blood and oxygenate the lungs.
❚ Defibrillation – Delivering an electrical shock to the heart
to restore a normal heart beat.
❚ Breathing tube and machine – Used to assist with breathing.
❚ Medicines – Given to restore an effective heart rate and
improve circulation of blood to major organs.

Living Will

A living will is a legal document that lets a person who is
unable to participate in decisions about their medical care
express their wishes about life-sustaining treatment. A living
will is usually used during a terminal illness when a person
is unable to communicate. A terminal illness is one in which
death is expected to occur with or without medical intervention
and also applies to an irreversible condition, when there is no
reasonable chance for recovery.
A living will guides health care providers and allows the patient
to set limits on what is done to them. You can personalize your
living will by including specific statements about the use of
medical treatments which may apply to your condition, including
CPR, blood transfusions, mechanical breathing, surgery, antibiotics,
kidney dialysis, and invasive measures to provide nutrition and
fluids. State laws vary in their requirements for living wills, so it
is advisable to contact a lawyer to make a living will that is valid
in your state.
