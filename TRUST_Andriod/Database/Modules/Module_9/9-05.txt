What Is an Advance Care Plan?

An advance care plan is a written document that helps you
to ensure that your care is customized to reflect your personal
preferences and health needs, as well as meet your social,
cultural, and religious requirements. It covers issues such as
whether you want to be resuscitated (revived if your heart stops
beating) or whether you want to have a mechanical ventilator
breathe for you if needed. You can also specify how you want
pain relieved if it develops and talk about how other medical
problems and complications should be handled if they occur.
An advance care plan does not guarantee that your instructions
will be followed, but it does substantially increase the likelihood.
Making sure that your advance care plan conforms to any legal
requirements in your state helps ensure that your health care
providers will comply with it.
Even if you do not create a written advance care plan, it
is important to let your health care providers, family, and
other caretakers know about your wishes regarding future
medical care.
