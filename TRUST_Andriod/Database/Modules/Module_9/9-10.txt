Getting Started on an Advance Care Plan

As part of responsible planning for the future, everyone should
make an advance care plan. While it may be difficult to discuss
death and dying with family and friends, everyone benefits from
knowing your wishes. Your family and friends may want to know
what you are feeling and thinking but may be afraid to ask you.
It might be easier if you bring the topic up first. For example,
you can trigger a meaningful discussion by saying:
❚ “I’d like to talk about what you should do in the event of
an emergency, especially one involving a cardiac arrest.”
❚ “It seems like I am more tired than I have been in the
past. I’d like to talk about what can be done to make
me feel better.”
❚ “Let’s talk about what we can do to make my life easier.”
❚ “I’d like to talk about the help we will need as my heart
failure worsens.”
❚ “We should explore what kind of support is available
when I can no longer take care of myself.”
