What to Do with Your Advance Care Plan

Make copies of your living will, do-not-resuscitate order,
health care power of attorney, or other directions about
medical treatment decisions (even if they are hand written)
and give them to your health care team. If you need to be
treated in a hospital, bring a copy with you. The hospital or
your doctor will keep a copy of these documents in your records
so that they have access to your wishes should they be needed.
If you have a health care power of attorney, give the person or
persons you have designated a copy of these documents as well.
You may also wish to carry a card in your wallet which states
that you have certain advance care directive documents and
include contact information for the people who have copies
of the documents.
Once you have prepared an advance care plan, be sure to review
and update it every few years to make sure it still describes your
wishes and meets current legal requirements.
