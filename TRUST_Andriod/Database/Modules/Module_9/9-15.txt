Making Care Choices

Home Health Care

Whether you choose a palliative care program, a hospice care
program, or no program at all, it is likely that you will feel more
tired and be short of breath as your heart failure progresses. Your
doctors and nurses may recommend home health care nursing
to monitor your status and adjust your therapy to keep you
comfortable without shortness of breath.
A home health care nurse can monitor your vital signs, weight,
heart failure status, blood laboratory work, and medication
dosing. He or she may also administer intravenous medications
at home to decrease your discomfort, pain or difficulty breathing,
and prevent hospitalization.
Other Supportive Care
Occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, and physical
therapists can help you move and breathe more easily and keep
your muscles conditioned so you have fewer aches and pains
with movement. These health care providers can also help you
get equipment so you can do your day-to-day activities more
easily. Examples include a shower stool, wheelchair, scooter,
home oxygen, or a ramp that goes over the stairs.
